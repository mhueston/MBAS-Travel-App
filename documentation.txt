Project Explanation

	The MBAS Travel Planner is a program that generates a custom travel package to any South American country for the user 
    based on their input. Their input includes their country of choice, their city of choice, when they would like to leave 
    for the trip, when they would like to return from the trip, their max flight price and their max hotel price.  The package 
    includes their outbound and inbound flight information, which can include 1 or more flights, their hotel information, the weather 
    in their country of choice during their stay, and popular events/places to visit in their country of choice.


How to run the program:

	1. There are 2 ways to run the MBAS Travel Planner program. The first way is within a code editor, such as VS Code. In the terminal input:

    python3 MBAS_Travel_Planner.py

    If running the program on VS code the user would need to install the bs4 module if not already downloaded using the command in their terminal: 

    pip install bs4


    2. The second way to run the program is through the flask webpage we created. To run the webpage you will need to have flask installed. Use this command in the terminal to do this: 

    pip install flask

    In the terminal, input:

    python3 app.py

    This will make the webpage active. In the terminal, it will provide a link to navigate to the webpage. Put that link in your browser and load the MBAS Travel Package webpage.


How to use/interpret the program:
	
	After running the program from the terminal it will ask for input for the country, city, start date, end date, max flight price, and max hotel price. Input these values and the program will output your custom travel package. 
    For example, if this is what your input looks like:

    Enter the South American country you would like to go to: Brazil
    Here are the top 5 tourist cities in Brazil
    ['Rio de Janeiro', 'São Paulo', 'Salvador', 'Brasília', 'Foz do Iguaçu']
    Enter the  city you would like to go to: Salvador
    Enter the origin airport code (e.g., JFK): BWI
    Enter the start date of the trip (YYYY-MM-DD): 2025-01-01
    Enter the end date of the trip (YYYY-MM-DD): 2025-01-10
    Enter the maximum flight price: 2000
    Enter the maximum hotel price per night: 500

    Then the output should look like this:
